# A project which uses Natural Language Processing to analyse emotions and sentiments of given texts.
-> analyse different emotions present in an essay like sadness, happiness, jealousy etc
-> find out the dominant emotion in the text
-> plot those emotions on a graph
-> tell whether the whole text is a positive or negative emotion
